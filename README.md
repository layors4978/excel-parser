# Excel parser

An excel parser using nest.js, but you need to write the code by yourself.

Need typescript experiences to use this repo.

## How to use

1. Go to /src/modules/excel then modify the code in excel.controller.ts and excel.service.ts.
2. Use postman, choose "send and download" to send a post request to route `<host>/excel/transform`.
